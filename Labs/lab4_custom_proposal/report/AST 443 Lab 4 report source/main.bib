	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {HD 189733 b is one of the most well studied exoplanets due to its large transit depth and host star brightness. The focus on this object has produced a number of high-cadence transit observations using high-resolution optical spectrographs. Here we present an analysis of seven full Hα transits of HD 189733 b using HARPS on the 3.6 meter La Silla telescope and HIRES on Keck I, taken over the course of nine years from 2006 to 2015. Hα transmission signals are analyzed as a function of the stellar activity level, as measured using the normalized core flux of the Ca ii H and K lines. We find strong variations in the strength of the Hα transmission spectrum from epoch to epoch. However, there is no clear trend between the Ca ii core emission and the strength of the in-transit Hα signal, although the transit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the most active. We present simulations of the in-transit contrast effect and find that the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong facular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line strengths. We also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of planetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due to large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet. Overall, we find it more likely that the measured Hα signals arise in the extended planetary atmosphere, although a better understanding of active region emission for active stars such as HD 189733 is needed.}

Using an ensemble of five-band Sloan filter observations across multiple transits we have created an ‘ultra-low’ resolution transmission spectrum to discern the nature of the exoplanet atmosphere. The observations were taken over three transit events and total 108 u′, 120 g′, 120 r′, 110 i′, and 116 z′ images with an average exposure cadence of seven minutes for an entire series. The analysis was performed with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method assisted by a Gaussian processes regression model. We find the apparent planet radius to increase from \\$0.154^\\{+0.00092\\}\_\\{-0.00096\\}\\$R* at z′ band to \\$0.157^\\{+0.00074\\}\_\\{-0.00078\\}\\$R* at u′ band. Whether this apparent radius implies an enhanced Rayleigh scattering or clear or grey planet atmosphere is highly dependent on stellar spot modelling assumptions, but our results are consistent with the literature for HD 189733b. This set of observations demonstrates the ability of our 2.3-m ground-based observatory to measure atmospheres of large exoplanets.}",

Outside of transits, there are quasi-periodic flux variations with a 13.4 day period that we attribute to stellar rotation.
