abstract = {We report 69 new times of maximum light for the SX Phoenicis star DY Pegasi. Combining these new times with previous published maxima, we found the data to be well modeled with a triple linear fit. However, we also determined a refined constant period change of − 6.00 × 10-12 days day−1. From both spectroscopic and photometric measurements, we determined − 0.8&lt;[Fe/H]&lt; -0.6. Using phase‐averaged indices, we found 〈Teff〉 = 7660 and 〈log g〉 = 3.89. From evolutionary models, a mass of M = 1.5 M⊙ and an age of 1.7 Gyr were determined.}
